To cover a result set larger than the cap, partition it instead of paging deeper: call gbif_occurrence_facets with facet DATASET_KEY, repeating this search's filters (every occurrence carries exactly one datasetKey, so the buckets cover the scope with no gaps or overlap, and facetOffset pages through them), then re-run this search once per datasetKey. A bucket still over the cap cuts further on BASIS_OF_RECORD or PUBLISHING_COUNTRY — the only other dimensions whose buckets leave no record out, and both have a matching filter here (basisOfRecord, publishingCountry). Do not take YEAR as the first cut — records without a year fall outside every year bucket, and MONTH, STATE_PROVINCE, and SPECIES_KEY lose records the same way, stateProvince included even though this tool can filter on it. Either second cut can also return a single bucket inside one dataset, so compare any sub-split's sum against the bucket total before relying on it. gbif_occurrence_facets takes no scientificName, month, latitude/longitude range, coordinate, cluster, or coordinate-uncertainty filter, so re-apply any of those on each per-datasetKey search rather than expecting the buckets to reflect them. Bucket counts reconcile against the occurrenceStatus in force, PRESENT by default here.
